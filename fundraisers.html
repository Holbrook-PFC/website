 <summary>Walk-A-Thon</summary>
<p>Each year, our students lace up their running shoes and hit the track to help raise funds for school projects and programs. It’s a fun and active way for students to get involved and make a difference in their school community!
  </p>

 <summary>Dollar-A-Day</summary>
 
<p>We ask families to consider donating $365 per student for the year — that's just $1 a day to help support vital programs, classroom supplies, events, and enrichment activities throughout the school year.

<p>Every dollar makes a difference, and your contribution helps create an exceptional experience for all our students!
