### PFC Donations

Have you made your donation to the Jet Off to Success Fund? Your donation is
critical to the success of our school and pays for the staff salaries and for
educational licensing such as RazKids and epic. Staff and programs that would
not otherwise exist at HOLA due to a lack of state funds.

Our goal is for 100% of families to donate what you can. Donations can be a
one-time gift, or a monthly gift, and your credit card will be charged the
amount you request each month. The suggested donation is $365 per student, or
just $1 per day. We encourage you to give what you can! All donations are 100%
tax deductible. Please also consider an Employee Match if one is offered by
your employer.
